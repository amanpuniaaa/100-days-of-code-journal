	<h1> Day 1 </h1>
    <br>

    <p> I just finished up playing some God Of War and started to setup my rig for the 100D (No this is not cup size, it's 100DaysOfCode). I already had 
    	Visual Studio Code installed but still I went ahead and uninstalled it for a fresh start.<br>
    	For C++, I had to download ming32-installer and select all the libraries to be installed. I download VSCode setup and installed that after that.
    	I wanted to try some Linux alternatives too (I installed Windows just to play GOW) so installed Geany. I have a custom config for Geany which makes it extremely fast and 
    	efficient to compile and run. PS: I did setup VSCode and Geany in Dark Mode, Geany's sidebars didn't change color so idk what to do with them.
    	A close friend of mine suggest use CP-Editor too, so I downloaded that one too, setup in Dark Mode and few KeyBinds. If I get some time, I'll post a way to config all of these. Also, 
    	gcc wasnt working so had to go ahead and add some permissions or file paths stuff to it (hehe, Windows Peasant).<br>
    	For Java, I installed Eclipse, saw this on my cousin's laptop few weeks ago, but let's see how it goes with it. I am adding the sources of studying in the 101's page,
		I wish someone literally spoonfeeded me like this.
		
	<p>I lowkey wanna install Ubuntu with the drop down terminal and just setup everything easy peasy with it. But alas, I have to complete this course and play GOW.
		I made some chill lofi playlists too, for future sessions. Having a chill lofi background does help in reading and napping. Also, I am addickted to coffee
		and pre-workout, taking 600mgs of caffiene isnt a great idea to start with.

	<p>I am making all the notes in Notion as it's super fun to use and quite comfy. I wanna share all my notes to you all but I can't buy a Personal Pro right now. But soon,
		I will sell some SaAS software and make some money (lol) and buy all this for my fellow coders.
	
	<p> So, it's Day 1 and I am covering the following topics:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction to C++ (some history lessons)</li>
		<li>Tokens in C++</li>
		<li>Hello World</li>
		<li>The function library iostream.h</li>
		<li></li>
	</ol>
